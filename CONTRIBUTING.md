## Release Procedure

**Before releasing, make sure that:**

1. all changes are merged into a single branch, named like the new version (e.g. `2.4.1`)
1. all Github issues associated with this release are closed
1. all Github issues associated with this release are attached to a milestone with the same name as the branch.

**To prepare the release, follow these steps:**

1. Add a new version to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) in the following format:

    ```
    # 2.4.1 (2015-06-01)

    * Docs: added release procedure (#97)
    * Updated dependencies (#96)
    ```

    Make sure to include the correct date of the release and the issue number for each change. If there's a change with
    no existing issue, write an issue that explains what the change is and why it was made and then add the number.

1. Change the package version in [package.json](package.json).

**After that, finally release:**

1. Merge the release branch into `master`
1. `git push` to github
1. Go to the [relases page](https://github.com/berlinonline/converjon/releases) and draft a new release.

    The relase name is the version number, with no prefix, only "2.4.1". The same for the tag version.

    For the description, copy the change list from the updated [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Only the changes, not the
    headline.
1. Publish the release. Github will automatically create a git tag.
1. On the master branch, run `npm publish`.
1. Close the Milestone.
