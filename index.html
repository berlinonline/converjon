        <p>Converjon is a tool for on-demand image processing to suit various needs in typical modern web applications
        that have a large variety of image content or target a wide range of devices.</p>

        <p>There's no need to crop images manually to fit all your thumbnail sizes, gallery formats, etc. With
        Converjon you can define what parts of your images are important. The areas of interest may be your products,
        faces or other details. Converjon will always crop your images ensuring the parts that matter the most to you
        are visible.</p>

        <div class="devices">
            <div class="laptop">
                <div class="screen">
                    <img src="images/laptop.jpg" alt="laptop image" />
                </div>
                <div class="body">
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="tablet">
                <img src="images/tablet.jpg" alt="tablet image" />
            </div>

            <div class="phone">
                <img src="images/phone.jpg" alt="tablet image" />
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Converjon removes the need to pre-generate all image sizes and resolutions that you might need. Instead, you
        can focus on your application, on your next layout or on supporting more target devices and screen
        sizes.</p>
