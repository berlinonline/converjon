## Installation

Use NPM: `npm install [-g] converjon`

## Usage

Start the server with `converjon [--config your_config_file]` or use the command line utility `converjon-cli` to work on local files.

Let's say you have an image at `http://example.org/image.jpg`. To get the image through Converjon, put the original URL into the request as a URL encoded parameter:

    http://localhost/?url=%20http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fimage.jpg

More options are available as GET parameters. All parameters need to be URL encoded.

Several examples are available on the `/demo` page which is enabled when starting Converjon with the [development config file](https://github.com/berlinonline/converjon/blob/master/config/development.yml) via ```converjon --dev```.

It's recommended to set the server port to `80` in [configuration](#server) and to run Converjon on a separate subdomain of your site or behind a reverse proxy like Nginx or Varnish.

### Changing size

You can either supply a `width`, `height` or both. If you only specify one dimension, the other one will be derived from the original image's aspect ratio.

If you set both values, the image may be cropped to the new aspect ratio and then resized to the requested pixel dimensions.

### Area of Interest

[Wiki: Area of Interest](https://github.com/berlinonline/converjon/wiki/Area-of-Interest)

By default images are cropped from the center of the original. You can specify an "area of interest" with the `aoi` parameter. The AOI is a rectangle in the following format:

    offsetX,offsetY,width,height

The AOI can also be embedded in the original image's metadata via EXIF or IPTC. The name of this metadata field can be configured and defaults to `aoi`. The request parameter overrides the AOI value from the image's metadata.

### Cropping mode

The `crop` parameter sets the cropping mode. Available modes are:

* `centered`
* `aoi_coverage`
* `aoi_emphasis`
* `aoi_auto`

Details about the cropping modes can be found [here in the wiki](https://github.com/berlinonline/converjon/wiki/Cropping-Modes). For examples, see the [demo page](http://berlinonline.github.io/converjon/demo/demo.html).

If an AOI is set, cropping will ensure, that the area is always preserved.

### Image Format

With the `format` parameter you can change the format of the image. Supported formats are:

* `jpg` or `jpeg`
* `png`
* `gif`

If no specific format is requested, the format of the source image will be used.

### Quality

The `quality` parameter sets the JPEG quality value. It ranges from `1` to `100`.

This parameter is ignored, if the requested format is not JPG.

### Color Palette

The `colors` parameter sets the number of colors for GIF compression. It ranges from 2 to 256 (integer).

### Interlaced Images

The `interlace` parameter allows the creation of interlaced images. Supported types of interlacing scheme are:

* `plane`(try this for JPEGs)
* `line`
* `none`

A well-known example of interlaced images are progressive JPEGs. You can use this option with PNGs and GIFs as well.

### Status Page

The URL `/status` leads to a summary of Converjon's current state and some statistics.

The status page is available as content type `application/json` via `/status.json`.

## Configuration

When launching converjon, you can specify one or more configuration files with the `--config` option which can be set
multiple times to load multiple config files.

You can use the [default.yml](https://github.com/berlinonline/converjon/blob/master/config/default.yml) or [development.yml](https://github.com/berlinonline/converjon/blob/master/config/development.yml) file as an example for writing your own.

The default configuration format is YAML but you can also use JSON files.

Every configuration file can be matched only to certain  image source URLs. If a config file contains a `urls` setting, that configuration will only apply to URLs that match at least one of the patterns from that list:

```YAML
# this config will only apply to source URLs from localhost or flickr
urls:
  - "http://localhost*" #this will match URLs on localhost, this is the dev/testing default
  - "http://www.flickr.com*"
```

Converjon uses [calmcard](https://github.com/lnwdr/calmcard) for string pattern matching. Documentation on how these patterns work can be found there.

This way you can define different setting depending on the source of the requested images.

### Server

 * `server.port`: port for the server to listen on
 * `server.instance_name`: the name of this server that will be displayed on the status page
 * `server.timout`: global timeout for incoming requests
    
    If not set, a random name will be generated.
 * `server.access_log_format`: the formatting of access logs:
    * `combined`: Apache Combined Log Format (the default)
    * `short`: leaves out the date/time information. Use this, if you use other software for log handling that adds timestamps.

### Downloads

**URL whitelists**
`download.url_whitelist` sets list of URL patterns that allowed to be requested as image sources.

For example, if you host your source images on `http://myimages.com/images/...` you should set the whitelist pattern to `http://myimages.com/images/` to make sure other sources are not allowed.

```YAML
# this will only allow requests for images from URLs that match these patterns
download:
  url_whitelist:
    - "http://localhost*"
    - "http://example.org/*
```
[Calmcard](https://github.com/lnwdr/calmcard) patterns are used for matching by default.

You can also prefix the pattern with ``~ `` (like ``~ ^http://(foo|bar)\.example.org\/.*``) to use regular expressions. For most cases, this should not be necessary and is discouraged.

**Timeout**
`download.timeout` sets a timeout after which requests are cancelled, if the source server doesn't respond in time.

**Reject Invalid SSL Certificates**
Setting `download.rejectInvalidSSL` to `true` will cause sources to be rejected, if their SSL certificates can nnot be validated.

### Cache

` cache.basepath` sets the base directory for the local file cache.

```YAML
cache:
  base_path: "/tmp/converjon/cache"
```

The cache directory is not automatically cleaned up and may grow over time.

### Processes

`process.limit` sets the maximum number of child processes that converjon will spawn for converting and analyzing images.

### Converter

`converter.padding_color` sets the background color that is used, if an image needs padding to fit the requested aspect ratio.

### Cropping

`cropping.default_mode` sets the default mode for cropping images. Possible options are: `centered`, `aoi_coverage`, `aoi_emphasis` and `aoi_auto`.

[Wiki: Cropping Modes](https://github.com/berlinonline/converjon/wiki/Cropping-Modes)

### Constraints

Constraints can be used to limit the possible request parameters, like width and height of images. Every constraint has a `min` and a `max` value:

```YAML
constraints:
  quality:
    min: 1
    max: 100
  colors:
    min: 1
    max: 256
  width:
    min: 1
    max: 10000
  height:
    min: 1
    max: 10000
```

### Logging

There are three logging levels: `access`, `error` and `debug`. Each of them can be directed to either STDOUT, STDERR or into a log file.

```YAML
logging:
  error: "stderr" # will log errors to STDERR
  debug: "stdout" # will log debug logs to STDOUT
  access: "/var/log/access.log" # will log requests into a log file
```

To disable a log level, set it to `false`.

Logs are not automatically rotated. Use of a tool like `logrotate` is recommended.

# Testing
