Converjon
=========

An on-the-fly image conversion service

Dependencies (apart from node modules)
-
  * ImageMagick
    * use the Q8 version to save memory
    * however, Q16 (the default one) is required to support PNG image output
  * ExifTool

Installation
-

  * download or clone the repository

  * `npm install -d` to install the dependency libs
  * set your environment (production/development/testing) via the `NODE_ENV` environment variable (defaults to "development")
  * start with `npm start`

Usage
-

Example image URL: http://example.org/image.jpg

To get the image through Converjon, put the original URL into the request as a URL encoded parameter:

    http://localhost/?url=%20http%3A%2F%2Fexample.org%2Fimage.jpg

More options are available as GET parameters. All parameters need to be URL encoded.

Several example are available on the `/demo` page which is enabled in "testing" and "development" environments.

###Changing size

You can either supply a `width`, `height` or both. If you only supply one dimension, the other one will be derived from the original images aspect ratio.

If you supply both values, the image will be cropped to the new aspect ratio, if necessary, and is then resized to the requested pixel dimensions.

###Area of Interest

By default images are cropped from the center of the original. You can specify an "area of interest" with the `aoi` parameter. The AOI is a rectangle in the folling format:
    
    offsetX,offsetY,width,height

The AOI can also be embedded in the original images metadata via EXIF or IPTC. The name of this metadata field can be configured and defaults to `aoi`. If the images metadata specifies an AOI, it is preferre over the AOI in the GET parameter.

If an AOI is set, croppping will ensure, that the area is always preserved.

###Image Format

With the `mime` parameter you can change the format of the image. Supported types are:
  * image/jpeg
  * image/png
  * image/gif

###Quality

The `quality` parameter sets the JPEG quality value. It ranges from 1 to 100 (integer).

This parameter is ignored, if the requested mime type is not `image/jpeg`.

###Color Palette

The `colors` parameter sets the number of colors for GIF compression. It ranges from 2 to 256 (integer).
